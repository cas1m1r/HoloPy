## TFT
First lets get the screen working

## Construction 
Now we can build the prism for generating the hologram. Using this plastic and a hotglue gun.

After its built we can test it works by using some videos already made on YouTube.

## Creating Holograms 
Center the prism on the display and start creating holograms! Right now I can only show single images at a time, and animation is kind of slow/distracting.
